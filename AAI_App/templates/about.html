                            <p>...is a global artistic movement started in Australia by a family of songwriters and music producers with a conscience.
                            We are a growing community of creative people collaborating to try and raise awareness, inspire change and encourage unity by harnessing the power of music for the greater good.
                            Creatively exploring, questioning and challenging through words, music and video.
                            Connecting with people on an intellectual level via the emotions.
                            Arousing wonder with thought provoking concepts which are well written and produced.
                            Concepts brought to life by talented humans from all walks of life all around the world.
