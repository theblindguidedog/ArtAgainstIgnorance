<h1>CRITICAL THINKING FOR KIDS</h1>

We are currently working with friend and artist Ganna (profile on website) on an animated series aimed at kids.
The concept revolves around encouraging kids to question everything and think critically.
It is a work in progress which we have realised can only be done consistently and convincingly in collaboration with knowledgeable and talented people within the community.
We'll keep you updated as to how it's all progressing here on our website but there is early access to updates for anyone supporting us on our Patreon (link)
